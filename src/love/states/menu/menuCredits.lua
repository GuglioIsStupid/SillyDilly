I made the background art for pasta night (the room itself not the characters) and for isotope, both of which I'm very proud of.

Everyone in the dev team is a goat, love them all to death, and working with them, becoming closer to them and just hanging out with them in general was the highlight of it all for me, it's not often you get to see a team feel so cozy and actually genuinely passionate about the product they're producing, and I couldn't ask for better.
